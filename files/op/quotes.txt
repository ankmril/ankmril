My favourite One Piece quotes:

1. "The injury to my name is much worse than the injury to my gut." - Roronoa Zoro, EP17

2. "I'd never lose to a pirate who ditches his name and runs away from the sea. The only time a pirate should abandon his name is when he dies!" - Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp's Arc/Captain Kuro

3. "Even the most insignificant person can still challenge the world's greatest hero if he tries hard enough." - Scorpion, EP101
